Class
    Foam::functionEntries::includeEtcEntry

Description
    A dictionary directive for including a file found using the
    Foam::findEtcFile() mechanism.

    Specify an etc file to include when reading dictionaries, expects a
    single string to follow.

    An example of the \c \#includeEtc directive:
    \verbatim
        #includeEtc "etcFile"
    \endverbatim

    The usual expansion of environment variables and other constructs is
    retained.
