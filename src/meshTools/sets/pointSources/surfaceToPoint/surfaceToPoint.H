Class
    Foam::surfaceToPoint

Description
    A topoSetPointSource to select points based on relation to surface.

    Select based on:
    - distance to surface
    - inside/outside status to surface
      (Uses normal of nearest surface triangle so requires valid surface
      topology!)

        includeOutside | Include outside cells (bool)   | yes   |
