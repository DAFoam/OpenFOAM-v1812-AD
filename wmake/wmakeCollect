Usage: $Script [OPTION] <command>

options:
  -clean            Clean-up before compilation (removes old makefiles)
  -kill             Clean-up after termination (removes makefiles)
  -h | -help        Print the usage

Collecting scheduler for fast parallel compilation of large numbers of object
files.  Can be used in compiling OpenFOAM by setting the WM_SCHEDULER variable.

When called with a compilation command it is written into a file in the
directory $WM_COLLECT_DIR.

When called without a command the files in the $WM_COLLECT_DIR directory are
combined into a single Makefile which is passed to make to compile all of the
object files efficiently in parallel.

Typical usage for compiling OpenFOAM:

  - Ensure all lnInclude directories are up-to-date:
    wmakeLnIncludeAll

  - Compile all with this scheduler:
    wmake -queue or wmake -q
